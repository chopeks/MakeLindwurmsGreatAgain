Bugfix mod for Lindwurms.

TL:DR; Less confusing Lindwurms in stats.

### Current fixes (all supported mods and vanilla): 
- counts Lindwurms as 1 enemy instead of 2 in battle screen,
- counts Lindwurms as 1 kill instead of 2 in battle summary,
- removes Lindwurm tail from XP calculation, as vanilla applies XP twice for each kill,
- compensates lost XP from killing tail as separate entity from body (XP is the same as it was in the end)

### For Legends Mod:
- fixes the double kill counting in related favourite enemy perk, 
- Stollwurm variant support

### For SSU Mod:
- Driad variant support

I have no idea, if double xp from both body and the tail is intended in vanilla, so I left original values here.
